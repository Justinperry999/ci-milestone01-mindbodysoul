            <h2>Eat healthier</h2>
            <p>Although following a balanced diet can help you lose weight or maintain a healthy weight, this is only
                one benefit.
                Those who follow a healthy, well-balanced diet reduce their risk of chronic diseases, such as diabetes,
                heart disease
                and cancer.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The key to a healthy diet is to eat the right amount of calories for how active you are so you balance
                the energy you
                consume with the energy you use.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You should also eat a wide range of foods to make sure you're getting a balanced diet and your body is
                receiving all the
                nutrients it needs.</p>
            <p>It's recommended that men have around 2,500 calories a day (10,500 kilojoules). Women should have around
                2,000 calories
                a day (8,400 kilojoules).</p>
