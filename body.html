            <h2>Try Yoga</h2>
            <p>Yoga is a vast collection of spiritual techniques and practices aimed at integrating mind, body, and
                spirit to achieve a
                state of enlightenment or oneness with the universe. What is normally thought of as “yoga” in the West
                is really HathaYoga, one of the many paths of yoga.
                <br>
                The different paths of yoga emphasize different approaches and
                techniques but ultimately lead to the same goal of unification and enlightenment.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Hatha Yoga attains the union of mind-body-spirit through a practice of asanas (yoga postures), pranayama
                (yoga breathing), mudra (body gestures), and shatkarma (internal cleansing). These physical practices
                are used
                to purify the body and cultivate prana (life-force energy). Modern Hatha Yoga does not emphasize many of
                these
                esoteric practices and instead focuses more on the physical yoga postures.</p>
            <br>
            <P>Yoga focuses on strength, flexibility and breathing to boost physical and mental wellbeing. There's some
                evidence that
                regular yoga practice helps people with high blood pressure, heart disease, aches and pains (including
                lower back pain),
                depression and stress.</P>
            <br>
            <h3>How to Practice Yoga</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Yoga is typically performed in bare feet on a sticky yoga mat with optional yoga props. <br> yoga
                movements and poses
                require clothes that can stretch and move freely with your body. You can purchase clothing specifically
                designed for
                yoga practice, but you can probably put together a comfortable outfit from your existing wardrobe to get
                started.</p>

            <h2>Eat healthier</h2>
            <p>Although following a balanced diet can help you lose weight or maintain a healthy weight, this is only
                one benefit.
                Those who follow a healthy, well-balanced diet reduce their risk of chronic diseases, such as diabetes,
                heart disease
                and cancer.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The key to a healthy diet is to eat the right amount of calories for how active you are so you balance
                the energy you
                consume with the energy you use.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You should also eat a wide range of foods to make sure you're getting a balanced diet and your body is
                receiving all the
                nutrients it needs.</p>
            <p>It's recommended that men have around 2,500 calories a day (10,500 kilojoules). Women should have around
                2,000 calories
                a day (8,400 kilojoules).</p>

            This image shows a food pyramid. It helps us identify the food groups people should combine in order to
            make a balanced
            diet. The food groups at the top of the pyramid should be eaten in moderation (small amount) but food groups
            at the
            bottom of the pyramid should be eaten in larger amounts.
