<img src="/assets/images/responsive-screenshot.png" alt="responsive designs">

Body & Mind is an informational website helping users to live a healthier life both mentally and physically. The site is aimed to help those who feel overwhelmed with everyday life by teaching them techniques like meditation and yoga to hopefully reduce stress and anxiety.

## **User Exerience (UX)**

### **Project Goals**

<ul>
<li>The website should have a tranquil design, appealing to customers interested in mindfulness</li>
<li>Have a layout which is easy to use and provide information clearly</li>
<li>To provide explanations and videos describing techniques in how to reduce stress and anxiety</li>
<li>Offer users a form to fill in to recieve a free ebook</li>
</ul>

### **Color Scheme**

The two main colors I've used for the site is a shade of **brown (#c39b7ed1)** and I've used **orange (#c68c53)** for hover effects. For the pages I've used a contrast of dark back background image and light writing so its easily readable.

### **Typography**

The main font I have used is Roboto Slab with San-Serif being the back-up font if Roboto Slab fails to load. For the headings I have used Pangolin and for the Logo I used Bench Nine as both of these are stand out fonts. I used Google Fonts to get an idea of what styles would be good to use on my site and I used Fontjoy for appropriate pairings.

### **Wireframes**

**Balsamiq** has been used to showcase the appearance of the site and display the placement of the different elements whitin the pages.

## **Features**

- To be responsive across all platforms.

- Color scheme maintained throughout all pages for good UX.

### Header

<img src="/assets/images/header.png" alt="Header">

- The header contains the site logo which links to the home page.

- The navigation bar is the same on each page of the site and includes links to the pages. The links also have a hover affect to change color for better UX.

### Footer

<img src="/assets/images/footer.png" alt="Footer">

- The footer contains links to social media platforms. Like the header the social media links also have a hover effect of the same color.

### Landing Page

<img src="/assets/images/main-screen.png" alt="Main page">

- For the main image on the landing page I've used a women meditating on wooden decking. This matches the brown and orange color scheme of the site and represents peace and mindfulness matching the sites goals.

- The landing page contains the About section which explains the purpose of the website.

### Mind Page

<img src="/assets/images/mind-screen.png" alt="Mind page">

- For the background image I used a man sitting on a rock peacefully looking out to sea. It has a calming feel to it. I have made the background image darker so that the writing can be seen more clearly.

- I've used three sections to provide information on different topics.

- Under the meditation section I have embedded a youtube video on meditation for better understanding.

### Body Page

<img src="/assets/images/body-screen.png" alt="Body page">

- Background image of a women doing yoga which fits really well in the body page. Again I've made the background image darker for better contrast.

- Same as the body page I've used 3 sections for information on seperate topics.

- I've embedded a youtube video under the yoga section as a guide for users.

### Soul Page

<img src="/assets/images/soul-screen.png" alt="Soul page">

- Same layout as the other two pages making the background image darker for better contrast.

- As there was less information on the 2 topics on the right 'Negative Thoughts' and 'Just Relax', I split the section in half and stacked them on top of eachother.

- Photos used from _Unsplash_ to link with bullet points.

### Form
