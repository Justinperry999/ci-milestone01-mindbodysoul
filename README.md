## **User Exerience (UX)**

---

### **Project Goals**

<ul>
<li>The website should have a tranquil design, appealing to customers interested in mindfulness</li>
<li>Have a layout which is easy to use and provide information clearly</li>
<li>To provide explanations and videos describing techniques in how to reduce stress and anxiety</li>
<li>Offer users a form to fill in to recieve a free ebook</li>
</ul>

### **Color Scheme**

The two main colors I've used for the site is a shade of <span style="color:#c39b7ed1">**brown (#c39b7ed1)**</span> and I've used <span style="color:#c68c53">**orange (#c68c53)**</span> for hover effects. For the pages I've used a contrast of dark back background image and light writing so its easily readable.

### **Typography**

The main font I have used is Roboto Slab with San-Serif being the back-up font if Roboto Slab fails to load. For the headings I have used Pangolin and for the Logo I used Bench Nine as both of these are stand out fonts. I used Google Fonts to get an idea of what styles would be good to use on my site and I used Fontjoy for appropriate pairings.

### **Wireframes**

**Balsamiq** has been used to showcase the appearance of the site and display the placement of the different elements whitin the pages.

### Header

<img src="/assets/Images/header.png" alt="Header">

- The header contains the site logo which links to the home page.

- The navigation bar is the same on each page of the site and includes links to the pages. The links also have a hover affect to change color for better UX.

### Footer

<img src="/assets/Images/footer.png" alt="Footer">

- The footer contains links to social media platforms. Like the header the social media links also have a hover effect of the same color.

### Landing Page

<img src="/assets/Images/main-screen.png" alt="Main page">

- For the main image on the landing page I've used a women meditating on wooden decking. This matches the brown and orange color scheme of the site and represents peace and mindfulness matching the sites goals.

- The landing page contains the About section which explains the purpose of the website.

### Mind Page

<img src="/assets/Images/mind-screen.png" alt="Mind page">

- For the background image I used a man sitting on a rock peacefully looking out to sea. It has a calming feel to it. I have made the background image darker so that the writing can be seen more clearly.

- I've used three sections to provide information on different topics.

- Under the meditation section I have embedded a youtube video on meditation for better understanding.

### Body Page

<img src="/assets/Images/body-screen.png" alt="Body page">

- Background image of a women doing yoga which fits really well in the body page. Again I've made the background image darker for better contrast.

- Same as the body page I've used 3 sections for information on seperate topics.

- I've embedded a youtube video under the yoga section as a guide for users.

### Soul Page

<img src="/assets/Images/soul-screen.png" alt="Soul page">

- Same layout as the other two pages making the background image darker for better contrast.

- As there was less information on the 2 topics on the right 'Negative Thoughts' and 'Just Relax', I split the section in half and stacked them on top of eachother.

- Photos used from _Unsplash_ to link with bullet points.

### Form

<img src="/assets/Images/form-screen.png" alt="Form page">
