            <h2>Digital Detox</h2>
            <p>Disconnect to reconnect. Disconnecting with technology and social media in particularly, allows us to
                reconnect with ourselves.
                Take a 15-30 minute detox from your device a day and enjoy some time to yourself without distraction.
                Start with 15-30 minutes and build up
                gradually to longer blocks of time.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Benefits of a digital detox include:</h3>
            <br>
            <h4>Reduce Stress</h4>
            <br>
            <p>In the American Psychological Associations' annual Stress in America survey, a fifth of U.S. adults
                (around 18%) cited
                technology use as a significant source of stress in their life. For many people, it is the ever-present
                digital
                connection and
                constant need to keep checking emails, texts, and social media that accounted for the majority of this
                tech stress.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Improves Sleep</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Being on your phone before bed can negatively impact sleep by engaging the mind at a time when it should
                be winding
                down.
                <br>
                There are a number of ground rules we can follow to limit the impact of phone use on our sleep.
                Switching off devices
                two hours before bed would be a dream scenario. An hour is commonly recommended, and perhaps more
                realistic.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Helps Maintain Work/Life Balance</h4>
            <br>
            <p>That feeling of always being connected can make it difficult to create boundaries between your home life
                and work life.
                Even when you are at home or on vacation, it can be hard to resist the temptation to check your email,
                respond to a text
                from a colleague, or check in on your social media accounts.</p>
            <p>Doing a digital detox may help you establish a healthier, less stressful work-life balance.</p>

            <h2>Meditation</h2>

            <p>Meditating is a proven way to reduce stress, lessen anxiety, and improve blood pressure. The simple act
                of closing
                your eyes and focusing on your breath can do wonders for your body</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Follow this step by step guide to learn the practice of meditation!</h3>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Sit up straight on your cushion or chair. Stay as straight as
                    possible.
                </li>
                <li>Rest your hands in a comfortable position.</li>
                <li>Tilt your chin downward and close your eyes. </li>
                <li>Start your timer. Start small with 3 to 5-minute sessions, and work up to 10, 20, or even 30-minute
                    sessions.</li>
                <li>Focus on your breathing. Concentrate on your inhales and exhales and and let the
                    worries of the outside world float away.</li>
                <li>Observe your breath without analyzing it. Concentrate on one
                    breath at a time.</li>
                <li>Bring your attention back to your breath if it wanders. </li>
                <li>Understand that meditating isn’t always easy. Try not to
                    be too hard on yourself when starting. You’ll build your meditating muscle
                    with time. After
                    all, being mindful is a lifelong goal.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Take time to read</h2>
            <P>Expand your mind and read something that you haven’t read before. Learn a new topic or delve deeper into
                something that
                you already love. Picking up an old favourite and refreshing your knowledge is not only a wonderful use
                of time but can
                positively affect your life in a huge way.</P>
            <br>
            <h3>Benefits Of Reading Include:</h3>
            <br>
            <h4>Reading Strengthens Your Brain</h4>
            <br>
            <p>A growing body of research indicates that reading literally changes your mind.</p>
            <p>In one study conducted in 2013, researchers used functional MRI scans to measure the effect of reading a
                novel on the brain. Study participants read the novel “Pompeii” over a period of 9 days. As tension
                built in the story,
                more and more areas of the brain lit up with activity.
                Brain scans showed that throughout the reading period and for days afterward, brain connectivity
                increased, especially
                in the somatosensory cortex, the part of the brain that responds to physical sensations like movement
                and pain.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Builds Your Vocabulary</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Research shows that 69 percent of employers are looking to hire people with
                “soft” skills, like
                the ability to communicate effectively. Reading books is the best way to increase your exposure to new
                words, learned in
                context.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Reduces Stress</h4>
            <br>
            <p>In 2009, a group of researchers measured the effects of yoga, humor, and reading on the stress levels of
                students in
                demanding health science programs in the United States.</p>
            <p>The study found that 30 minutes of reading lowered blood pressure, heart rate, and feelings of
                psychological distress
                just as effectively as yoga and humor did.</p>
