            <h2>Positive Affirmations</h2>
            <p>If you’ve never used them before then you might feel a bit silly at first but they’ve always helped me
                and so I wanted to include them here.
                <br><br>
                You can create your own, be sure to keep them positive and in the present tense -
                for example “I am welcoming love into my life".
                <br>
                Say them outloud when you can but in your head is just fine too.
                <br>
                I like to choose one for the day or sometimes the week or month if I’m working on a particular issue.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>What exactly are postive affirmations?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Positive affirmations are self-affirming phrases that people repeat out loud. Dr Moses says they’re
                “designed to promote
                positive thoughts, feelings and attitudes”. The sentences chosen are specific and individual to each
                person.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Research by psychologists has shown that positive affirmations can help with the following:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Reducing stress</li>
                <li>Increasing physical activity</li>
                <li>Promoting healthy eating habits</li>
                <li>Improving relationships</li>
                <li>Enhancing academic performance</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Here are some positive mental health affirmations to get you started:</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>I know my worth</li>
                <li>I am worthy of receiving good things and of accomplishing my goals in life</li>
                <li>I am a strong, capable person</li>
                <li>I don’t have to give up my hopes and dreams</li>
                <li>Negative thoughts do not serve me anymore</li>
                <li>I am proud of myself and will continue to strive to do well</li>
                <li>I love my body, my mind, my dreams, and my goals</li>
                <li>I forgive myself for mistakes I made and I refuse to hold them against myself</li>
                <li>All this hard work I am putting into achieving my goals will pay off</li>
                <li>Today I will do my best</li>
            </ol>

                    Forgiveness will help give you energy, carry less stress and even perform daily task more
                    efficiently.

                    <h3>Play with a pup</h3>
                    <p>Patting a pup or playing with a kitten has been shown to reduce
                        blood pressure and stress hormones. Senior dogs tend to be calm, mellow, sweet and lovable,
                        and
                        they’re always so happy to be with you. This, of course, is good
                        for the soul!</p>

                    in this universe, the universe is living within us,” astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson once said in
                    a
                    lecture.

                <h2>Throw away your negative thoughts</h2>

                <p>Take five minutes to jot down everything that is bothering you and then tear the paper up into
                    little pieces and throw it away. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Literally throw away those negative thoughts!</p>
                <br>
                <p>You’d be surprised how good this feels (alternatively, you can burn the pieces in a flameproof dish
                    and return the
                    ashes to the earth symbolising letting go of your troubles.)</p>
                <br>
                <p>In a new study, researchers found that when people wrote down their thoughts on a piece of paper and
                    then threw that piece of paper away,
                    they mentally discarded the thoughts as well.</p>
                <br>
                <p>whereas on the other hand, people were more likely to
                    use their
                    thoughts when making judgments if they wrote them down first on a piece of paper and then tucked the
                    paper into their pocket to protect it.</p>

                <h2>Just Relax</h2>
                <P>With today’s modern lifestyle we all know how stressful it can be. Between work, family, and social
                    obligations, it can
                    feel impossible to make time for yourself. But it’s important to find the time.
                </P>
                <br>
                <p>Relaxing can help keep you healthy, in both your mind and body, helping you recover from the everyday
                    stresses that life
                    throws at you.</p>
                <br>
                <p>There are many benefits to keeping your brain and body relaxed. Relaxation balances out the negative
                    mental and physical
                    effects of stress that we all experience every day.</P>
                <br>
                <p>Stress may be a universal part of everyday life, but that doesn’t mean you should let it get the best
                    of you. Take charge and
                    control your stress by taking a short amount of time everyday and
