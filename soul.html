            <h2>Positive Affirmations</h2>

            <p>If you’ve never used them before then you might feel a bit silly at first but they’ve always helped me
                and so I wanted to include them here.
                <br><br>
                You can create your own, be sure to keep them positive and in the present tense -
                for example “I am welcoming love into my life".
                <br>
                Say them outloud when you can but in your head is just fine too.
                <br>
                I like to choose one for the day or sometimes the week or month if I’m working on a particular issue.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>What exactly are postive affirmations?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Positive affirmations are self-affirming phrases that people repeat out loud. Dr Moses says they’re
                “designed to promote
                positive thoughts, feelings and attitudes”. The sentences chosen are specific and individual to each
                person.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Research by psychologists has shown that positive affirmations can help with the following:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Reducing stress</li>
                <li>Increasing physical activity</li>
                <li>Promoting healthy eating habits</li>
                <li>Improving relationships</li>
                <li>Enhancing academic performance</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Here are some positive mental health affirmations to get you started:</h3>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>I know my worth</li>
                <li>I am worthy of receiving good things and of accomplishing my goals in life</li>
                <li>I am a strong, capable person</li>
                <li>I don’t have to give up my hopes and dreams</li>
                <li>Negative thoughts do not serve me anymore</li>
                <li>I am proud of myself and will continue to strive to do well</li>
                <li>I love my body, my mind, my dreams, and my goals</li>
                <li>I forgive myself for mistakes I made and I refuse to hold them against myself</li>
                <li>All this hard work I am putting into achieving my goals will pay off</li>
                <li>Today I will do my best</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Take some time in the day to be calm</h2>
            <P>About</P>

                <h2>Write what bothers you and throw it away</h2>

                <p>Take five minutes to write down everything that is bothering you today and then rip the paper up into
                    little pieces and throw it away.
                    <br>
                    You’d be surprised how good this feels (alternatively, if you’re at home, burn the pieces
                    safely in a flameproof dish and return the ashes to the earth to symbolise letting go of your
                    troubles.)
